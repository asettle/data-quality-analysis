# Data Quality Analysis as a Precursor to Machine Learning Activities

A student-information-system (SIS) intends to include additional ML-based
insights into its management reporting suite. One of the csv data files
used to prime the SIS Machine Learning application has been found to have
significant data quality issues.

You have been asked to provide advice and guidance on the steps that need
to be taken to clean the data file as part of quality assurance for the ML
system.

## To complete this assignment:

Carry out the following tasks

1. Perform detailed analysis of data quality for the dataset provided, making
   use of some of the criteria discussed in the weekâ€™s lectures.
2. Map out, in outline form, what data cleansing measures would need to be put
   in place to prepare the dataset for ML work.
3. Indicate the types of Pandas-Scikit-Learn python commands that could be used
   whilst carrying out the measures you suggested in task 2.
4. Attempt a clean-up of the dataset using the procedures set out in (2) and
   (3) and report on the degree of success with carrying this out.
